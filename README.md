TIC-TAC-TOE Game

A simple two player Tic-Tac-Toe (or Knots and Crosses) game.
Players can set their names to the markers they wish to use and
can take turns, with visual cues, until a winner or tie are found. 
The game keeps a running tally of each player's score and displys
it on screen.

This was a challenging project, especially the game-solving logic,
but I very much enjoyed learning how to use modules to encapsulate
the work being done, as security and global variables have been a
concern of mine this entire course.
